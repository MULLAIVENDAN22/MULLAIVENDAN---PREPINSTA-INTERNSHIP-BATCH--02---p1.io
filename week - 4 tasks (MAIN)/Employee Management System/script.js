 /*  Part 1 - Employee Management System:

        Letâ€™s consider a real-world scenario where we have a list of employees in an organization and we want 
        to perform various tasks using JavaScript:

            Create an Employee Object:
                Define an object template for an employee containing attributes like name, age, department, and salary.
                Each employee should be represented as an object with these attributes.
            Calculate Average Salary:
                Write a function that takes an array of employee objects as input and calculates the average
                salary of all employees.
            Find Employees in a Department:
                Write a function that takes an array of employee objects and a department name as input.
                Return an array containing all employees who belong to the specified department.
            Increase Salary for Employees:
            Write a function that takes an array of employee objects and a percentage increase as input.
                Increase the salary of each employee in the array by the specified percentage.
            Sort Employees by Age:
                Write a function that takes an array of employee objects and sorts them based on their age in ascending order.
                Return the sorted array of employee object
