<!-- Scenario 3: Designing a Blog Post

You're working on designing a blog post for a website. The blog post should have a header with the post title,
 an author's name, and a publication date. It should also include the main content of the blog post with paragraphs
 of text. You want to add a custom favicon to the page to represent the blog.
Create the HTML structure for the blog post, including div, p, section, img, font, favicon, anchor, and span tags.

Feel free to use the HTML tags creatively to structure your pages based on these scenarios. -->
